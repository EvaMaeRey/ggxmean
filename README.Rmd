# ggxmean

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ggxmean is plot the mean of x - and some other things like y! 

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/ggxmean")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggxmean)

## basic example code
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed,
      y = dist) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_xvlines(alpha = .1,
               linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_xmean(color = "firebrick",
             size = 2,
             linetype = "dotted")
```


# another case with faceting

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = wt) + 
  aes(y = mpg) +
  geom_xmean(linetype = "dashed") + # won't appear w/o point, not sure why
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(cyl))
```
